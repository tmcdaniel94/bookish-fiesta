# Text Editor Starter Code

## Description
This text editor project is a Progressive Web Application (PWA) that leverages service workers and IndexedDB to provide an offline-first experience. The app allows users to create, edit, and save notes locally, even without an internet connection. By utilizing service workers, the app ensures smooth functionality, caching assets, and enabling background sync when the user is online again. IndexedDB is used to store the user's data in the browser, making it persistent across sessions. This combination of technologies allows the app to work seamlessly both online and offline, offering a robust and responsive text editing experience.
